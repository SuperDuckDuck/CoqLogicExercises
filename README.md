- scroll down for exercises in FOL (first order logic)  
- for original source code (using plain ascii instead of unicode) and alternative/other solutions have a look at the "src" folder  

## Propositional Logic

Proof the following theorems

**Exercise 1: A -> A**
```Coq
Lemma Ex01_1 : forall A : Prop , A -> A .
Proof.
  intros.
  exact H.
Qed.
```

**Exercise 2: A -> B -> A**

```coq
Lemma Ex02_1 : forall (A B : Prop), A -> B -> A.
Proof. 
  intros.
  exact H.
Qed.
```


**Exercise 3: **
